# PetBook

This was apart of the CodeAcademy Front-End course. The goal was to take what I've learnt so far and create a web-app to showcase the knowledge and skills I've developed so far. This is my first React project, compared to what I was capable of before I started this is a huge leap and I am much more confident in my knowledge. 

## Function over form

It was difficult for me but I've intentionally NOT created this to look or feel polished. Instead of spending days working on the UI/UX this is intended as functionality practice so it lacks much aesthetic polish. What is there simply works.

### Redux

I learnt Redux for the state management in this project, in hindsight it might've not been complex enough to justify this but in the future this will set-up me up to better apply it.

#### What's next?

1. Continue the CodeAcademy course and recieve the certificate.
2. Learn TypeScript and use it in my next project.
3. Complete a project that starts in Figma to accuretly replicate the stages of professional development. This will allow me to segment the design & development phases and focus on perfecting one before the other.
4. Make a less generic project. Don't do a basic 'social media' clone every Tom Dick & Harry has. Make something unique, cool and out the box even if it requires more JavaScript. (especially if it requires more complicated JS. Think futureproof).
